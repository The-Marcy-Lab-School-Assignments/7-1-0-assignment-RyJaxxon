# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer

1. Create a context folder with context.jsx and provider.jsx files.
2. Create the context object in context.jsx using the createContext hook and export it
3. In our provider file, import the context we just created
4. In the same file, create a function called Provider and inside create any props who's context you'd like to be global.
5. Again in the Provider function, return the Context.Provider wrapper with the value equal the props you'd like to be global context. Inside this wrapper put an object `{ children }` (this represents any child elements).
6. Export!
7. Finally, in our main.jsx file, import our Provider function and wrap our `<App />` component with it!
